> **Note:** This project emerged from the final assignment of *High Performance Computing* course and was out of pure personal interest, thus containing astoundingly immature implementation that works even slower than the sequential version.

An attempt to parallelize [Pattern-Defeating Quicksort (Orson Peters, 2021)](https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort) using IntelÂ® oneAPI toolkit with support of C++20 features including `std::ranges` and `concept`s. This C++ implementation is based on that of `std::slice::sort_unstable` written in Rust. The project is still in progress.
